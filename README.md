# Onur Akay University - Campus Network Design

In this project, an **enterprise level network infrastructure** for the entire campus of **Onur Akay University**, a fictitious university, is designed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The goal is to create a real-world structure with a **scalable**, **secure** and **highly available** architecture.

**Note**: This project focuses on designing a large-scale campus network, so I kept the spotlight on the overall architecture and left out the finer details for now.

## Campus Distribution

### HQ ###

### BRANCH ###

| Location | Segments |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Administrative Building** | Rectorate, IT Building |
| **West Campus** | Faculty of Science | 
| **East Campus** | Faculty of Pharmacy |
| **North Campus** | Library, Halls, Laboratories |
| **Branch Campus** | Engineering, Foreign Languages, Faculty of Sports, Applied Sciences |

**Note**: All Access Points are managed by a single WLC (connected to CORE-1) with CAPWAP.

---

## Network Architecture

The network structure is based on a **3-layer hierarchical model**:

### Core Layer
- **CORE-1 and CORE-2** multilayer switches
- High-speed point-to-point connectivity (redundant links) to all distribution layers
- WLC and external links are located at this layer

### Distribution Layer
- 1 or 2 L3 distribution switches in each campus area
- Redundant gateway structure with **VLAN routing + HSRP**
- OSPF works in Area 0

### Access Layer
- Separate access switches for each building
- End user connections separated into VLANs
- Port security active

---

## Features

### Dynamic routing
- OSPF was used between Core and Distribution devices in HQ. Point-to-point structure (/30) was preferred to limit broadcast domains.
- The connections between Core-Firewall, ISP and Internet also work with OSPF.
- Branch1, which represents the branches, has a similar OSPF configuration.

### VLAN Gateway Redundancy
HSRP has been configured to ensure high availability between Core and Collapsed Core devices.

### **Security**
Port Security, BPDU Guard, Blackhole VLAN (vlan333), not using VLAN1 etc. measures and ACLs were used to ensure LAN security and compliance with ISO 27001 Information Security Management System standards.

**Firewall (ASA)**
- Internal (INSIDE), external (OUTSIDE) and DMZ zones were defined
- Traffic from DMZ and OUTSIDE was given access only on certain service ports (HTTP, DNS, FTP, etc.)
- Internal networks (INSIDE1 and INSIDE2) exit to the outside world via NAT.
- Service based traffic control with ACL
- CAPWAP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, FTP permissions

### **WLAN**
- WLC (on CORE-1)
- CAPWAP communication with APs on branch campus.

**Note**: Due to limitations in Packet Tracer regarding wireless distance calculations and connecting to random APs, all wireless devices have been **disabled in the overview screenshot**. Devices were connecting to random APs. Here is how they work properly:

### **DMZ zone**
- DHCP (with redundancy), DNS, WEB, MAIL, FTP, NTP, SYSLOG, TFTP servers
- These servers are NATed behind the firewall

### **Internet**
  - HQ-FRW and B-FRW are connected to the outside world (Internet) and the Internet is simulated with Google.
  - With OSPF all routes, including internet routers, are dynamically distributed.
**Note**: Due to limitations in Packet Tracer regarding wireless distance calculations, all wireless connecting to random APs. Here is how they work properly:

####DERLE

- **WLC (on CORE-1)**:
  - VLAN 30 (staff/student) and VLAN 35 (guest) management
 - CAPWAP communication with APs on branch campus


- **DHCP server (in DMZ)**:
  - Redundancy supported
 - IP, DNS and default gateway distribution
- **SSH management** provided only over VLAN 15
- **ACL** with external access restrictions to the management VLAN
- **Port security**: Security measures such as Sticky MAC, closing all unused ports by assigning them to VLAN 333
 - All unused ports are closed by assigning them to VLAN 333
- **STP security**: `portfast` and `bpduguard` are active
- **NTP service** is provided via DHCP server

- **Subnet**: `10.20.20.0/27`  
- **Usage**: Hosting services like Mail, DNS, DHCP, etc., behind the firewall with NAT.



Future plans:

* ISP redundancy
* Campus dormitories will be added and policies implemented will be determined
* more detailed acl
